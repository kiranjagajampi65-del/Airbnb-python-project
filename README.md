Airbnb Listings Exploratory Data Analysis – New York (2024)
Project Overview
I analyzed 20,765 Airbnb listings across New York City to understand what drives pricing, how different room types perform, availability patterns, and host behaviors. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncovers practical insights that guests and hosts can use to make smarter decisions.

Objectives
Analyze price variations across different neighborhoods
Examine the distribution of room types and availability
Study host behavior and listing patterns
Identify and manage price outliers
Provide actionable insights based on the analysis
